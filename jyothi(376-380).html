        <p >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warehousing of patient data, particularly in a CHIN domain, offers the industry<br>
            the capability to more efficiency identify risk factors associated with disease episodes<br>
            and prevention-focused public health requirements, and to electronically link the diverse<br>
            players (e.g., providers and payors – insurance companies) along the health care<br>
            continuum. Moreover, such applications lend themselves to intelligent data analysis<br>
            that require accurate data quality technologies in the mining of health care data.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To determine how warehoused health care data can be best utilized, one can return<br>
         to the outcomes of the CHIN cases. One recurring theme from each of the cases was the<br>
          need to access data for resource utilization and determination of medical outcomes within<br>
           a broader population, in general, and single patient, in particular. Other uses of these<br>
            data include pattern identification by sample groups by statistically slicing the data by<br>
             demographic, socio-economic and other characteristics. All of these uses of warehoused<br></p>
             <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;health care data stimulate more effective and efficient deployment resources and <br>
                knowledge bases among communities - thereby influencing public policy implications. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  While data-mining applications offer the industry these and other advantages, the <br>
                social challenges abound. The erosion of personal privacy and the security of the data <br>
                remain formidable issues. These are particularly of issue regarding existing health care <br>
                Web sites (e.g., http://www.webmd.com, http://www.mayoclinic.com) that enable con- <br>
                sumers to track data (e.g., on AIDS/HIV, diabetes, cancer, sickle cell anemia, etc.) and can <br>
                provide marketing and medical leads for drug manufacturers and health care insurers. 
             </p>
             <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) U.S. Public Policy <br>
                Committee (http://www/acm.org/usacm) and other industry groups, horror stories about <br>
                unauthorized disclosure of patient information are numerous; consumers continue to <br>
                battle the losses and costs associated with privacy invasion. As pointed out by Barbara <br>
                Simons, chair of the ACM Public Policy Committee, (http://www.acm.org/usacm/pri-<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    vacy/simons_medical.html) drafts from the National Information Infrastructure Task<br>
                Force stated:<br>
             </p>
            

             <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“medical information is routinely shared with and viewed by third parties who <br>
                are not involved in patient care. The American Medical Records Association <br>
                has identified twelve categories of information seekers outside the health care <br>
                industry who have access to health care files, including employers, govern- <br>
                ment agencies, credit bureaus, insures, educational institutions and the <br>
                media.”<br>
             </p>
             <p >
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Further, and in the context of data mining and CHINs, several questions remain <br>
                unanswered with regard to the warehousing and mining of health care information:<br>
              1)Who owns the data?<br>
                2)	What are the costs associated with the “inability” to mine community data?<br>
                3)	What security policies and procedures should be implemented in a CHIN (data- mining) application?<br>
                4)	How do CHINs improve public health?<br>
                5)	How should organizational practices be re-engineered to ensure that security policies and procedures are practiced within the organization?<br>
             </p>

             <p style="font-size: 16px; padding-left: 12%;"  ><b>CONCLUSION</b><br></p>
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed IOS implementation model derived from Cooper and Zmud’s (1990)<br>
                 single organization model is able to capture the some aspects of CHIN implementation. <br>
                 The model, however, seems best suited to less competitive market situations where there<br>
                  is recognition that competition does not necessarily preclude interorganizational coop- <br>
                  eration. Further, my results suggest that competition is the overriding factor in the model,<br>
                   thereby implying that not all variables in the model are equally important. Health care <br>
                   organizations in some more competitive markets have yet to rationalize the web of players <br>
                   (e.g., physicians and production workers, payors, providers, patients, government, and <br>
                   larger external environment) that directly affect its (in)ability to form cooperative <br>
                   ventures. The case data indicate that large health care providers and payors in some <br>
                   markets are evolving toward less cooperative, more coercive IOS strategies. These <br>
                   organizations mandate IT direction, infrastructure support, and the degree to which <br>
                   competitors will form cooperatives. This is evident in emerging health care organizations,<br>
                    such as Healtheon/WebMD and CyberCare.</p><br>
                    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These results, while interesting, must be viewed as preliminary. This was an<br>
                         exploratory study and was limited to CHINs located in the Midwest. CHINs implemented<br>
                         in what the industry considers more advanced health care states, such as Oregon,<br>
                          Minnesota and California, are characterized by a high degree of managed care and<br>
                          competition, and potentially can be impacted by a different set of conditions. Thus,<br>
                           another implementation model or subset of the current model may be more appropriate,<br>
                           and these results may not be applicable in more mature health care markets. Moreover,<br>
                            these early CHIN efforts speak to the challenges the industry faces as we enter the age  <br>
                            of customer (patient) relationship and supply chain models that stand to debunk archaic<br>
                             views of care delivery, patient as primary consumers, information privacy, and data <br>
                             management.  </p><br>

        <p><i>This chapter focuses on the potential contributions that Data Mining (DM) could make <br>
            within the Human Resource (HR) function in organizations. We first provide a basic <br>
            introduction to DM techniques and processes and a survey of the literature on the steps<br>
             involved in successfully mining this information. We also discuss the importance of data<br>
              warehousing and datamart considerations. An examination of the contrast between<br>
               DM and more routine statistical studies is given, and the value of HR information to <br>
               support a firm’s competitive position and organizational decision-making is considered.<br>
                Examples of potential applications are outlined in terms of data that is ordinarily<br>
             captured in HR information systems.</i></p><br>

                parallel to business-related technological advances. HR professionals are now able to<br>
                 dedicate more time to strategic business decisions as the development of technology has<br>
                  allowed for the automation of many transactional HR processes (Walker &Reif, 1999).<br>
                   While HR professionals may no longer need to manage the manual processing of data, <br>
                   they should not abandon their ties to data collected on and about the organization’s<br>
